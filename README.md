# audionodes
A demo Blender addon for audionodes.

Just install audionodes.py like any other Blender Addon and enable it.

You can then try the audio nodes in the node editor.

Note: You can only playback the sounds in the node editor, but not do anything else with them.

Warning: You can't stop playback, so if you choose a very long sound it will play until the end. An unlimited sine will play forever (ie. until you close Blender).
